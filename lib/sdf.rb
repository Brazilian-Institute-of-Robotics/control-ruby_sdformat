# What is SDF
# -----------
# SDF is an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot
# simulators, visualization, and control. Originally developed as part of the
# Gazebo robot simulator, SDF was designed with scientific robot applications in
# mind. Over the years, SDF has become a stable, robust, and extensible format
# capable of describing all aspects of robots, static and dynamic objects,
# lighting, terrain, and even physics.
